# Personal Portfolio Website

This project demonstrates my ability to work with **Flexbox** and **Grid** layout methods, showcasing various properties in a portfolio website format. The project was completed in three parts: implementing layout methods, building the website using Flexbox and Grid, and migrating it to React.

## Part 1: Flexbox & Grid Layout Mastery
In this part, I demonstrated my understanding and application of Flexbox and Grid layout methods by using various properties in the styling of the components. Below are the key properties I implemented:

### Flexbox Properties:
- `display: flex`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `align-self`
- `flex-direction`
- `flex-wrap`
- `gap`

### Grid Properties:
- `display: grid`
- `grid-template-columns`
- `grid-template-rows`
- `grid-gap`
- `grid-area`
- `align-items`
- `justify-items`

## Part 2: Building Personal Portfolio Website
For this part, I used the Flexbox and Grid layout methods to build a personal portfolio website. The website includes sections such as **About Me**, **Skills**, **Interests**, **Languages**, and a **Footer**. The layout adapts to different screen sizes to provide a responsive experience.

### Flexbox Layout:
- Used Flexbox to align sections vertically and horizontally.
- Applied properties like `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.

### Grid Layout:
- Employed Grid for the **Skills** section to display skill cards in a responsive grid format.
- Utilized `grid-template-columns` to create dynamic columns.

## Part 3: Migrating to React
In this part, I migrated the Flexbox and Grid layout-based portfolio to React. I broke down the portfolio into reusable components such as **Greeting**, **AboutMe**, **Skills**, **Interests**, **Languages**, and **Footer**.

### React Features:
- Created components using `function` components.
- Used `props` to pass data and manage layout.
- Utilized `import` statements to bring in external CSS files.
- Managed styling in separate CSS files for better organization.
